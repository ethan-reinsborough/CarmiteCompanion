A unique take on a Discord bot using Canvas, the Riot API, and Ddragon which allows users to view their match history straight from Discord! Matches are loaded and cached (up to 20) upon execution which is then paginated, each with its own custom-generated image embed that has coordinate-based star levels, champion splashes, and more! This is a personal project to be used by myself and my friends, and I plan on polishing it with items, augments, game status (using TFT Spectator V5), and more! Plenty of bots and apps have stats handled already, so Carmite Companion (named after my league account name) aims to bring a unique take with creative features.
This is a reimagining of a previous Canvas command I had made, brought to life with new Discord slash commands and pagination for compact usability!
